# CloudWalk-challenge

## The challenge it was done on Java technology - I used the same ruby project structure
### To install Java and Maven.
### Used Maven to install the dependencies

### Erase the "resust.json" file on the "result" folder and run on terminal, on the root of java project:

```bash
    mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.game.App
```

### obs1: the result json it is not in order, this is an enhance that I have to do.
### obs2: I did the project on Java technology now because Ruby it is not so common anymore on tests.
