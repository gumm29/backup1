# CloudWalk-challenge

## The challenge it was done on Ruby technology

### To install ruby, access [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)

### To run the task, you have to install the json dependence on the root of the project (depending of your OS, you have to write the follow command with sudo):
```bash
    bundle install
```
### Or you can just install on the root of projet on terminal, the library itself because it is just one:
```bash
    gem install json
```

### After that, you can run:
```bash
    ruby game.rb
```

### It will make the json filter and generate a file with the json on the "result" folder.

### The log it is located on "log" folder.

### On "game.rb" file have the main logic of the filters and on the "methods.rb" file there are the oop methods.


### I did the challenge on Java as well, it is on "cloudwalk - java" folder, click [here](cloudwalk-java/README.md) to see the java instructions.
